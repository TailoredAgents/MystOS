## Pressure Washing Pricing Made Simple

Our pricing engine considers property size, surfaces, travel zone, and seasonal factors. Every visit is quoted on-site and backed by our 48-hour make-it-right guarantee.

### Residential Ranges

- House exterior soft wash: typically $75-$200 per side based on size and elevations.
- Driveways, sidewalks, and concrete pads: about $0.14 per square foot (e.g., a 600 sq ft drive runs ~$85).
- Roof cleaning: $500-$1,800 depending on roof pitch, stories, and access.
- Gutters and downspouts: $150-$600 based on home length and height.
- Decks & patios: $125-$600 depending on square footage and railing detail.
- Exterior windows: $10-$15 per window depending on grid detail and accessibility.

### What's Included

- Complimentary exterior walkthrough, surface inspection, and a written on-site estimate.
- Soft-wash chemistries, plant pre-soaks, and bleach neutralizer to protect landscaping, pets, and finishes.
- Detailed finish work, spot checks, and a rinse-down of nearby patios, entries, or garage doors before we leave.
- Optional water supply from our truck-mounted tanks ($150) for properties without spigot access.

### Bundle & Save

Our Good, Better, Best bundles pair popular services for seasonal refreshes. Ask your specialist to recommend the best fit for your property, or layer add-ons like window cleaning, oxidation removal, rust removal, or sealer application.

### Commercial Properties

- Storefronts, office parks, HOA amenities, and shared spaces are priced after an on-site walk to capture square footage, drainage, and access.
- We accommodate 7 AM-7 PM scheduling and after-hours windows to avoid disrupting business.
- COIs, vendor onboarding, and multi-site quotes are available on request.
